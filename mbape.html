                1 Player of The Year at the age of 20. He signed his first <br> professional contract in 2016. A lot can happen in four years when you’ve got the world at your feet.

            <pre class="genesis-p">
                 Like most maestros, Mbappé was a natural. His coaches at 
                 AS Bondy say he was ‘’born into football’’. Bondy was a place
                 where they never gave him special treatment. He was
                 challenged, pressure was applied, a diamond formed. He
                 learnt how to hustle. Thishumility created the perfect foil
                 for the daring, breathless ball of tricky elasticity we’ve come
                 to know as Kylian Mbappé.
            </pre>
            <h1 class="genesis-head"> <i> THE WARM UP </i></h1>
            <pre class="genesis-p">
                Mbappé, age 12, would attend France’s famous finishing 
                school - Clairefontaine, home to legends such as Thierry 
                Henry, Nicolas Anelka, and many of Mbappé’s peers. Whilst 
                training at Clairefontaine, Mbappé would go back home 
                every weekend to continue playing for AS Bondy. The boy 
                was bonded to Bondy, to his roots. Mbappé understood 
                exactly what it would take for him to achieve his dreams. 
                This is why, despite being part of a long-line of famous 
                alumni at Clairefontaine, none have made history as quickly 
                as Kylian has.

            <pre class="meet-p">
                As with all wunderkids, there were murmurs of a new, 
                French ‘’you know who’’. But, we’d heard it all before. We 
                needed evidence. His dizzying runs, flicks, tricks, and finally - 
                goals in the 2017 UEFA Champions League sent his club on a 
                thrilling semi-final run. He was clearly talented. But it was at 
                the 2018 FIFA World Cup™ that Mbappé’s sparkling ability 
                crystallized for everybody to see. Mbappé was the leading 
                light, winning the Best Young Player award and scoring two 
                goals in the final to scoop the FIFA World Cup™ for France. 
                Kylian was now the ice-cold torchbearer, the one who had 
                turned the faltering red flame of Les Bleus, blue once again. 
           </pre>
            <h1 class="meet-head"> <i> HOW IT'S DONE </i></h1>
            <pre class="meet-p">
                Mbappé’s style of play fuses flair, finesse, and oozes fun. 
                Whether he’s pirouetting away from defenders to create 
                space for a shot on goal or exploding through the lines at 
                lightning speed during a counter-attack; Mbappé cannot be 
                missed. Literally. Inspired by the Ballon d’Or winners of days 
                past, Mbappé’s skill set feels both new and old. Old in the 
                sense that his showmanship gets you off your seat, as all the 
                great attackers did. But it feels new with this modern, 
                tactical flexibility, meaning Mbappé can be a threat from 
                anywhere: a defender’s nightmare.
